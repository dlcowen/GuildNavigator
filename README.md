# CloudTrail Log Explorer

## Overview

The CloudTrail Log Explorer is a Python-based GUI application designed to simplify the process of discovering, downloading, and managing AWS CloudTrail logs. It provides an intuitive graphical interface built with Tkinter, allowing users to easily authenticate with AWS, assume roles, and transfer logs from S3 buckets.

## Features

- **AWS Authentication**: Supports authentication via AWS profiles or direct API keys.
- **Role Management**: Automatically detects and assumes AWS IAM roles, preventing redundant role assumptions.
- **Log Discovery**: Scans and identifies CloudTrail logs within specified date ranges.
- **Log Transfer**: Efficiently downloads CloudTrail logs from S3 buckets using multiprocessing.
- **Resume Capability**: Allows resuming interrupted transfers without rescanning the entire bucket.
- **Error Logging and Tracking**: Comprehensive logging of errors and failed transfers, with detailed reports.
- **User-Friendly GUI**: Real-time progress updates, error notifications, and easy access to logs.

## Examples

### Example: Starting a Transfer

1. Authenticate using your AWS profile.
2. Enter the AWS account ID and CloudTrail trail name.

## Troubleshooting

- **Role Assumption Errors**: Ensure the role you're trying to assume has the correct trust relationships and permissions.
